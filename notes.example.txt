Slide 2 (Text): Introduction

Speaker Notes: Open source solutions in SAST, DAST and SCA are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility. These tools can help businesses to identify vulnerabilities in their applications and ensure that they are secure.

Slide 3 (Bullet Points): SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Speaker Notes: SAST is a tool that can help businesses to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process. It can be integrated with the CI/CD pipeline and has customizable rulesets. However, it has some limitations, such as false positives, limited coverage of runtime issues, and requires source code access.

Slide 4 (Bullet Points): DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

Speaker Notes: DAST is a tool that can accurately detect vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks. It does not require access to source code and can provide a comprehensive view of the application's security. However, it has some limitations, such as limited coverage of backend systems, high rate of false positives, and limited scalability.

Slide 5 (Bullet Points): SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

Speaker Notes: SCA is a tool that can help businesses to identify open source components and detect known vulnerabilities. It can be integrated with the CI/CD pipeline and provides a comprehensive view of the application's security. However, it has some limitations, such as limited coverage of proprietary code, false positives, and limited support for some programming languages.

Slide 6 (Text): Conclusion

Speaker Notes: Open source solutions in SAST, DAST and SCA offer a cost-effective and flexible approach to application security.
